	<b>Character Sketch Demo v0.1 - Changelog</b><br><br>
	
	First Version Uploaded!<br><br>
	
	<b>Added:</b>
	<br>+44 playable scenes (about 90% of the full game)
	<br>+4 Main Decisions that decide the path you're going (Encounter 2 of them per playthrough on average)
	<br>+4 Endings and 5 Gamepaths (Endings are a bit chopped off due to missing h-scenes, will rush the h-scenes to complete them with next update)
	<br>(one gamepath is experimental and was supposed to get removed. It will go about halfway and then switch over to another path which will lead to some confusion. Will be fully implemented to work with said path in future updates.)
	<br>~40 Music Tracks and a variety of background sounds that play in the background of various scenes
	<br>~280 Character Sketches used in scenes along the game
	<br>(Still missing about 220 which are mostly removed from this demo for censoring purpose since I still need to add clothing to them.)
	<br>(Partly replaced by censored/recolored versions to make it easier for me to find them again.)
	<br>+Updated and reimplemented the Supporter List. Patrons will randomly be chosen from a supporter list to appear on the title screen. 
	<br> New: A gold/silver token will appear next to the supporter name dependend on their support so far.)
	<br>(Will go through some slight variations in later updates.)
	<br>(Please let me know over at Patreon if you would like to change/remove your name from the list or similear, I'll gladly change up how it works for you.)
	<br>+Ability to change the name of the Player and his Braixen.
	
	<br><br><b>Still missing:</b><br>
	For Full Sketch Demo:
	<br>-Hentai Scenes (9 main scenes, 4 unlockable bonus scenes.)
	<br>-1 major scene that needs to be reworked before I will add it back in
	<br>-CG Sketches (Random Image Scenes that will show as Events instead of the usual Character Scenes. Probably most work out of all of them)
	<br>(Will definitely remove some of them, for now it's simple descriptions of how the CG would look like.)
	<br>-Minor Decisions (Won't decide the ending/path itself but might block of some of the main decisions if choosen porly)
	<br>
	<br>For Full Game:
	<br>-Coloration
	<br>-Animations and Character Models
	<br>-Stylist
	<br>-Gallery
	<br>-Updated UI and Settings
	<br>-Minigames and Inventory
	<br>-Backgrounds (Already bought licenses for some to make work easier for me. Editing them for the game will be the only thing needed to do.)

	<br><br><b>Will be added/worked on with next update:</b>
	<br>*Main Hentai Scenes (Will be added as sketches+written text/story to finish the chopped off endings)
	<br>*Fixes for bugs that were missed on last release
	<br>*Last major scene that needs rewriting to connect two of the paths
	<br>*missing character sketches and clothing for them
	<br>*some gallery and setting related ui
	
	<br><br><b>Known Bugs so far:</b>
	<br>~Patron Silver Token seems to dissapear in of of it's animation frames for some reason
	<br>~Gold/Silver Patrons will change the color of Fia's name in debug screen (not a problem in itself)
	<br>~UI doesn't work properly yet and especially the Settings Screen will be buggy/hard to use
	<br>~Character Names won't always be replaced with the names entered by the player. (Will show Player/Braixen instead)
	<br>~Playthrough Achievements will only be visible after restarting
